A community reporting platform is a digital tool that allows individuals to report local issues, concerns—such as potholes, broken streetlights or environmental hazards—directly to relevant authorities. It helps improve transparency, accountability, and civic engagement by enabling real-time feedback and collaborative problem-solving.
